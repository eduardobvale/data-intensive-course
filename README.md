This is a repo to keep all my exercices of a course on Data Intesive Applications. 

This course is based on the book "Designing Dataâ€“Intensive Applications: The Big Ideas Behind Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Systems".

The professor is going to explore many aspects of data systems and databases from Relational to NoSQL.

Until now, we have explored these concepts:

- EER diagrams and mapping
- NoSQL concepts
- Document based databases mapping
- Graph databases
